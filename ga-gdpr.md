The Austrian Data Protection Authority (DSB) has declared that the data transfer from the EU to the US through Google Analytics is illegal. This is a groundbreaking decision, as millions of websites worldwide rely on Google Analytics and is considered the industry standard.

[noyb](https://noyb.eu/en/austrian-dsb-eu-us-data-transfers-google-analytics-illegal) initiated the decision by filing the [101 model complaints](https://noyb.eu/en/101-complaints-eu-us-transfers-filed) after the "Schrems II" decision, which rendered the EU-US data transfer agrement illegal in 2020. Back then the European Court of Justice decided that US providers violate the GDPR, as US authorities gain access to personal information of EU citzens.

Instead of adapting to the GDPR, US companies tried to manouver around the issue by updating their privacy policies and ignored the court decision, giving them an unfair advantage over EU based companies.

Other EU countries are expected to follow the DSB decision.

## What Can I Do About It as a Website Owner?

We recommend removing Google Analytics from any website you own. While it might take a while until other EU countries follow the Austrian decision, and it's unlikely that you will get sued in the next few weeks or months, it's best to be on the save side. The court didn't decide on the penalty yet, but the GDPR foresees penalties of up to 20â‚¬ million or 4% of global turnover.

A lot of businesses depend on Google Analytics to measure their marketing campaigns and basic website performance metics. Most of the these key metrics can easily be measured with a GDPR compliant alternative, like [Pirsch](https://pirsch.io) or [other european-based web analytics solutions](https://european-alternatives.eu/category/web-analytics-services).

In the long run, US companies will have to adapt or will be replaced by GDPR compliant solutions.
