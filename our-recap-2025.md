Now in its fifth year, Pirsch is more stable than ever before, with slow but steady growth. We gained a new large enterprise client and introduced plenty of new features and improvements.

I'm not entirely satisfied with what we achieved in 2025. We had much bigger plans with Pirsch, but due to some personal projects — namely, renovating a house that I had bought — we didn't manage to work on the big changes. Looking back at 2025, our progress wasn't as poor as it feels. I keep forgetting a lot of the stuff that was added :)

## The Numbers

As with last year, let's start with the numbers.

* We grew our MRR from around $11,000 to around $14,300 (a 24% increase)
* Our monthly growth rate was 0.7%
* Net volume was around $130,000
* Subscribers grew from 553 to 627
* We added one new enterprise customer in the health sector
* The number of employees remained at one (although the two co-founders occasionally work on Pirsch)

As you can see, growth has slowed down. We experienced increased competition in 2025, and the market appears more fragmented. Nevertheless, our customers value our fast, experienced support, setting us apart from competitors who are essentially copying our analytics product without a deeper understanding of the subject matter. I would assume that AI has lowered the barrier to creating SaaS products that people don't know much about.

## The Features

Here's a quick summary of what's new and what we've improved in 2025:

* In January, we added a URL shortener, a great tool for reliably tracking link clicks
* We also added conversion rate graphs for all statistics, showing how many visitors you had for a specific metric over time
* User-set annotations in the top graphs to save events and highlights
* AI traffic channels
* More granular hourly statistics by filtering for a day and time
* A new WordPress plugin
* A color blind mode for the dashboard
* Google Search Console keyword filtering right on the dashboard
* Huge bot filter improvements (more on that below)

Of course, lots of convenient features were added, such as autocompletion for funnels and much more besides!

## Euro Subscriptions

One major change to our subscription model was enforcing payments in euros for anyone living in the eurozone. The main reason for this change was that we were losing about 10% of each payment due to currency conversions. Previously, the subscription dialogue was unclear and offered the option to pay in dollars even if you lived in a Eurozone country.

This change caused some problems, as we had to manually notify customers who couldn't be charged after the change. I think we lost a few customers in the process, but mostly because they weren't using Pirsch anymore or had already decided to cancel their subscriptions.

## Our Biggest Pain - Bot Filtering

By far our biggest pain point in 2025 was bot traffic. We saw a significant increase in traffic from AI crawlers and spammers, which forced us to implement more stringent filtering and manually clean up data in certain instances. I don't think it's hardly surprising that AI crawlers and agents try to mimic real browsers and visitors, which makes it difficult to filter them correctly. However, I believe we have done a good job, and we will continue to fight this battle, making your statistics as accurate as possible!

By the way, this is also what sets us apart from copycats and even Google Analytics.

## Plans for 2026

The plan for 2026 stays mostly unchanged.

Our focus will be on API version 2.0, which was announced in 2024. This will make it much simpler to work with while increasing its flexibility. A new permission model will be introduced to unify access management, which is currently divided between user accounts, teams and dashboards. Subsequently, we will improve the dashboard by adding Sankey diagrams and cleaning up the settings pages.

I also plan to publish more blog posts. As you may have noticed, I have significantly slowed down compared to previous years, for the reasons mentioned above. I hope to write at least one post per month (no AI-slop, of course, but DeepL will remain a trusted friend of mine).

## Wrapping Up

Thank you for reading our recap, and for using Pirsch! We hope you have a great year in 2026!
