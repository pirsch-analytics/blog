# Web Analytics and Privacy

* What is web analytics and why is it useful?
* Data points and FLoC
* How does privacy-friendly analytics work? Why can't the data points be connected to build a profile?
* Technical details (from Pirsch) and why network communication can always be "tracked"
* Conclusion

Myth are ranking around web analytics and how it is evil outside the marketeers and tech-savvy bubble. Most website visitors know web analytics just as "the annoying cookie banner I have to click away", but there are legitimate reasons to do web analytics, and ways to do it in a privacy-friendly manner without disrupting visitors.

In this article, I would like to explain what web analytics is, how it functions, and when it's actually bad in as simple terms as possible. There will be a more technical focused section at the end, but I hope this article helps to clear a few things up.
